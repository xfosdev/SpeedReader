is a full-text site browser for Firefox.  It improves your experience when browsing   
large number of similarly formatted web pages (e.g. reading *ALL* stories on a   
front page.)  

It eliminates many repetive tasks such as link following, tab handling,  
bookmarking and site backtracking.  

You get the whole story, in ‚ùí3D, quickly.
