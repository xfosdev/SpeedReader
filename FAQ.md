Speed Reader Frequently Asked Questions
=======================================
    
    
**Q: Nothing is happening,  what do I do?**  
- *Are you using NoScript?*  
Allow `xfos.net`
      
- *Are you on the full Internet?*  
Many corporate networks randomly block traffic.  Make sure you can make   
outbound TCP connection to port `5252`
    
- *Do you have a Private Window open?*  
The current version does not fully support Private Windows.  As a workaround,  
*disable* and *re-enable* Speed Reader in `Tools` ➜ `Add-Ons` ➜ `Extensions`  
for temporary revival
  

**Q: Will you support Chrome?**    
A: No
