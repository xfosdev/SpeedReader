Speed Reader Frequently Asked Questions
=======================================
    
    
**Q: Nothing is happening,  what do I do ?**  
- *Are you using NoScript?*  
Allow `xfos.net`.
      
- *Are you on the full Internet?*  
Many corporate networks randomly block traffic.  Make sure you can make   
outbound TCP connection to port `5252`.
    
- *Do you have a Private Window open?*  
The current version does not fully support Private Windows.  As a workaround,  
*disable* and *re-enable* Speed Reader in `Tools` ➜ `Add-Ons` ➜ `Extensions`  
for temporary revival.
  
    
  
**Q: How do I tell Speed Reader to recognize the newly adapted site ?**    
A: Clear the cache. `Preferences...` ➜ `Advanced` ➜ `Network` ➜ `Cached Web Content`.  
  
  
  
**Q: Will you add support for site *xyz* ?**    
A: Gladly.  Attach a few annotated screenshots and describe the area 
of interest in your [*feature request*](https://github.com/xfosdev/SpeedReader/issues).
    

    
**Q: Will you support Chrome ?**    
A: No.
